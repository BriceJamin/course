# General case 

* mostly exos use the `Exercice` class

# regexps

* `W6/w6_regexp.py` uses the `ExerciceRegexp` and `ExerciceRegexpGroups` subclasses; input is not a function but some form of regexp string.

# others

There remains some other usages of `Exercice` that are not straightforward, makes sense to document them as they come up.
