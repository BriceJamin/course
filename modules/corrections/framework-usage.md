## General case 

* mostly exos use the `ExerciceFunction` class

## regexps

* `W6/w6_regexp.py` uses the `ExerciceRegexp` and `ExerciceRegexpGroups` subclasses; input is not a function but some form of regexp string.

## others

There remains some other usages of `ExerciceFunction` that are not straightforward, makes sense to document them as they come up.
